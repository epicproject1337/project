- We need to discuss what diagrams we need to create
- We need to discuss if we will use Goodreads API
## Reports from previous meeting
- Keep working on the prototype application
## Discussion items
- Domain model:
  - Our domain model was more of a class UML diagram
  - What should be on the domain model?
- Contact with seller:
  - mail? chat? sms?
  - new page (fragment or activity)?
- Diagrams:
  - SSD? UML? USE CASE?
- Goodreads API:
  - Add some books to our own database so we dont need to use their API aswell as easier to implement for the prototype
  - Would have more books with goodreads API
## Outcomes and assignments
- We decided to read up on what a domain model really is and refactor ours
- We decided to contact the seller by using an expanding button on the ad that sends a pre-written mail to the seller
- We decided to write descriptions on our tasks on trello for an easier time knowing what we need to do to complete the task
- We decided to create SSD for the most crucial functions and use our old domain model to create a good class UML
## Wrap up
- We will decided when we will have the next meeting in our groupchat
