## Objectives
- We need to discuss new solutions for our UI testing problems. 
## Reports from previous meeting
- We've come further in the process of testing but there is still alot of problems.
## Discussion items
- UI testing:
  - Try espresso recording test
## Outcomes and assignments
- We are going to try doing espresso recording tests for the tests of the UI. This makes testing easier because the test is recording an action.
- We need to be done polishing the app's functions.
- Next week are we going to write the last iteration of the RAD and SDD. 
## Wrap up
- Next meeting next week will be decided in the group chat.
