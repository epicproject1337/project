# Meeting Agenda
Group: Grupp1337  
Date: 2020-09-24   
Participants: Alexander Jyborn, Oscar Bennet, Albin Landgren, Tarik Porobic, Pajam Khoshnam  
## Objectives
- We must discuss the goodreads API
- We must discuss what we have to do before the peer review
- We must discuss definition of done
## Reports from previous meeting
- We made some changes in the graphical prototype for the addAd page. 
## Discussion items
- Goodreads API:
  - Too much time
  - Use our own database
  - Maybe implement API later
- Peer review: 
  - Work on existing functions not new ones. 
- Definition of done:
  - Description task of each TODO card. 
## Outcomes and assignments
- We decided to wait with the implementation of the goodreads API and instead add books to our own database. The reason for this is that the implementation of the goodreads API will be very time consuming. We will implement the API later on in the project if we have time. 
- We decided that are not going to implement any new functions until after the peer review. We are only going to work on existing functions. 
- We are going to write definition of done in the task description of each TODO card. For example are some tasks not done until they have been tested. 
- Tarik is going to change addAd to match the graphical prototype.
- Pajam will add subscriptions to the database so users are able to subscribe to a book. 
- Oscar continues with search fragment.
- Alexander continues with the camera. 
- Albin creates the design of the profile page. 
## Wrap up
- Next meeting next week will be decided in the groupchat.
