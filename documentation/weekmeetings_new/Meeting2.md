# Det som står i week2 och meetingweek2 möte 1 i gamla
## Objectives
- We must discuss how to create a better work flow in trello.
- We must discuss how to create a better structure for user stories. 
## Reports from previous meeting
- User stories have been created
- The graphical prototype was created in Figma
- Activities and fragments have been created to match the pages from the graphical prototype
- The login page is semi-implemented
- First iteration of the domain model have been created
- The implementation of the navigation has started 
## Discussion items
- Better work flow in trello:
  - Create TODO cards
  - Assign people to tasks
- Better structure user stories:
  - Mark with number
  - Create tasks in user stories 
## Outcomes and assignments
- We decided to create TODO cards and assign the person which is going to work on the task. The reason for this is to easily see which person is working on which task. 
- After consultation with supervisor we decided to mark each user story with a number to easily match each task with a TODO card. 
- The user stories are going to contain tasks that must be implemented for the user story to be complete.
- Oscar will start the implementation of the search page
- Tarik will do the same but with the ads page
- Alexander with the camera
- Pajam with the search function
- and Albin with the navigation between pages. 
## Wrap up
- Next meeting later this week. Will be decided in the group chat.
